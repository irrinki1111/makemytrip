          As a software tester, you'll be involved in the quality assurance stage of software development and deployment. 
          You'll conduct automated and manual tests to ensure the software created by developers is fit for purpose and any bugs or issues are removed within a product before it gets deployed to everyday users.

          Your role is integral to the creation of software systems and technical products including vehicles, electronic goods, 
          defence, and healthcare. 
          You might work on bespoke, individual projects or multinational projects spanning the globe and costing billions of pounds. 
          You'll need to be familiar, or become familiar with, programming and using coding languages.
